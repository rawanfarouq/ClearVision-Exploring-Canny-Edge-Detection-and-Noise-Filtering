# ClearVision-Exploring-Canny-Edge-Detection-and-Noise-Filtering
ClearVision is a Computer Vision project focused on analyzing the performance of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm under different types of image noise (Salt & Pepper, Gaussian, Poisson, and Random). It evaluates the effectiveness of average filtering techniques (3x3, 5x5, and 9x9 filters) in reducing noise while balancing image detail preservation. The project provides insights into selecting optimal filtering strategies based on noise characteristics and desired image clarity.
